# FakkuSukebeiSearcher
lists all fakku doujin names and their torrent links taken from sukebei user rbot2000

the plan is you'd search on the fakku website for a doujin you want, then Ctrl + f the name in output.txt

if you don't find it, try checking the links with missing filelists, if that fails wait, eventually (and hopefully) rbot2000 will upload them (from my(my friend's) observation about once every 2 weeks) and you can run the script again to generate a new list
